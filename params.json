  "body": "## Introduction\r\nMultimaze is an application to run a basic multiplayer two-player maze solving competitive game with basic chat functionality. It utilizes Node.js and some Node.js packages. At most, it has features such as auto-room allocation, score keeping, and realtime opponent movement. The client uses [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) alongside [JQuery](https://jquery.com/).\r\n\r\n## More details\r\nMultimaze uses [socket.io](http://socket.io/) to create rooms with the max size of two, so that only 1v1 games exist. Users receive everything in the `client` folder for easy modification. The server has two main purposes: it acts as a relay for client-client data, and acts as an authority for sending seeds which the client generates the maze. The maze itself is generated via [Kruskal's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm), which was chosen because [Prim's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm) was no fun. This project was created to demonstrate my ability.\r\n\r\n## How to run\r\n\r\n*If you already know how to run and install a Node.js server, you can skip this section. Simply run `node server.js` located within the `server` folder*\r\n\r\nFirst, install NodeJS from [their official webpage](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).\r\n\r\nMultimaze has two dependencies, [Express](expressjs.com) and [socket.io](http://socket.io/). If you do not have these Node.js pacakages installed, you can install them by running `npm install` while your working directory is within the `server` folder.\r\n\r\n    cd /path/to/directory/server\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\nThen, simply run Node.js on the `server.js` file by running the following command, again while in the `server` folder.\r\n\r\n    node server\r\n\r\n## Copyright and thanks\r\n\r\nThis project has a MIT license.
